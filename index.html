    <h1>Healthy Lifestyle</h1>
    <p>In this article you can find out about healthy lifestyle.</p>

    <h2>Nutrition — The Foundation of Good Health</h2>
    <p>Eating a balanced diet is essential for overall well-being. Include a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins like fish,<br>
        beans, or chicken, and healthy fats such as nuts and olive oil.Limit processed foods, sugary drinks, and fried meals, which can increase the risk of chronic<br>
         diseases. Stay hydrated by drinking water throughout the day, and eat slowly to help your body recognize when it’s full.<br>
        Balance, not perfection, is the key — healthy choices most of the time lead to lasting results.</p>

    <h2>Exercise — Move for a Healthier Life</h2>
    <p>Regular physical activity keeps your body strong, your mind clear, and your energy levels high. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity <br>
        exercise per week — activities like brisk walking, cycling, or swimming are great choices.Include strength training two or more times a week <br> 
        to build muscle, protect your joints, and boost your metabolism. Even short sessions of movement throughout the day — taking the stairs, stretching,<br>
        or quick walks — can make a difference. Consistency matters more than perfection. Find activities you enjoy and make them a regular part of your routine.</p>

    <h2>Sleep — Recharge Your Body and Mind</h2>
    <p>Getting enough quality sleep is essential for physical and mental health. Most adults need 7–9 hours of sleep each night to stay alert, focused, and energized.<br>
        Establish a consistent sleep schedule by going to bed and waking up at the same time every day, even on weekends.Create a relaxing bedtime routine — dim the lights,<br>
        avoid screens, and take time to unwind before sleep. Make sure your bedroom is cool, dark, and quiet to promote deeper rest. Good sleep supports your immune system,<br>
        balances your mood, and helps your body recover from daily stress.</p>

    <h2>Healthy habits</h2>
    <p>Incorporate healthy habits into your daily routine, such as staying hydrated, <br>
        managing stress through mindfulness or meditation, and avoiding harmful behaviors like smoking and excessive alcohol consumption. <br>
        Regular health check-ups can also help in early detection and prevention of diseases.</p>
